# SkeetBot (now BrookeBot (Now Archived))

Is a helper for user control on Remo. Tracked bans, new users, possible alternate accounts, etc.

Also got rolled into some discord specific reporting like user joins and leaves, deleted messages, etc.

User control is now at https://github.com/remotv/User-Moderation

Discord control is now handled via Dyno.
